                <p>My typeface of choice is Neue Frutiger
                World, sourced from the Monotype Type
                Foundry, designed and directed by Akira
                Kobayashi, who had his start in
                designing Japanese fonts. Neue Frutiger
                World is a humanist, sans serif typeface,
                designed with readability, language
                diversity, and UX accessibility in mind.</p>

                <div class="body2"><P>Neue Frutiger World is based on the original
                    "Frutiger" typeface which was designed by Adrian
                    Frutiger. The type face is meant to embody all that
                    is identifiable with the original, clarity and warmth,
                    while also expanding the global version to 10
                    weights and designing the typeface in 250
                    languages, including Latin, Greek, Cyrillic,
                    Georgian, Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic, Thai and
                    Vietnamese.</P>
                    
                    <p>Overall the invention of this font was was
                    intended to expand different font weights in bolds
                    to global consumers who otherwise may not have
                    had access to such weights in their language. The
                    typeface is strongly associated with corporate
                    advertising, print, signage, and UX aesthetics in
                    mind for a pleasant user experience on a global
                    scale. Typefaces like these are enjoyed among
                    youthful subcultures and aesthetic retrospective
                    trends like "Frutiger Aero." For a largely corporate
                    associated typeface, it is appreciated for refreshing
                    sensibility and accessibility!
